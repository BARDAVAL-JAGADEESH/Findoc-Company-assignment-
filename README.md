# Flutter Bloc Login App

This is a simple Flutter application I built to demonstrate login functionality with form validation using Bloc, along with image fetching from an API. The app has two screens ‚Äî a Login Screen and a Home Screen ‚Äî and uses the [Picsum API](https://picsum.photos) to fetch and display images.

## üîê Login Screen

The login screen contains:
- An **email** input field
- A **password** input field
- A **submit** button

### ‚úÖ Validation Rules:
- **Email:** Must be in a valid email format.
- **Password:** 
  - At least 8 characters
  - Includes one uppercase letter
  - Includes one lowercase letter
  - Includes one number
  - Includes one special character

When valid credentials are entered (see below), the app navigates to the Home Screen.

## üè† Home Screen

Once logged in, the Home Screen displays a list of **10 random images** fetched from the [Picsum API](https://picsum.photos/v2/list).

### üìã Each list item includes:
- The image (full screen width, maintaining aspect ratio)
- The author name (styled using **Montserrat Semi-Bold**)
- Image ID as description (styled with **Montserrat Regular**, dark grey, max 2 lines)
